          text: 'Ever since the priesthood was restored in 1829, the early Saints had been blessed by the Lord’s sacred power. They were baptized, confirmed, and called to serve by priesthood authority, much like we are today. But having access to priesthood power is not the same thing as completely understanding it, and God had more He wanted His Saints to understand—particularly with the coming restoration of temple ordinances. The 1832 revelation on the priesthood, now D&C 84, expanded the Saints’ vision of what the priesthood really is. And it can do the same for us today. After all, there is a lot to learn about the divine power that holds “the key of the knowledge of God,” that makes manifest “the power of godliness,” and that prepares us to “see the face of God, even the Father, and live” (verses 19–22).'
