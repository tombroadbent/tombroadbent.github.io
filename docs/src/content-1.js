But it must have been particularly difficult in late 1831 when Ezra Booth began publicly berating the Church, because in this case the critic was a former believer. Ezra had seen Joseph use God’s power to heal a woman. He had been invited to accompany Joseph on the first survey of the land of Zion in Missouri. But he had since lost his faith and, in an attempt to discredit the Prophet, published a series of letters in an Ohio newspaper. And his efforts seemed to be working, because “unfriendly feelings … had developed against the Church” (Doctrine and Covenants 71, section heading).'

While there is not one right answer for every situation, it seems that often—including in this case in 1831—part of the Lord’s answer is to declare the truth and correct falsehoods by “proclaiming [the] gospel” (D&C 71:1). Yes, the Lord’s work will always have critics, but in the end, “no weapon that is formed against [it] shall prosper” (D&C 71:9).'
